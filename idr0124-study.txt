Protocol Description	Images where acquired using confocal microscopy and features extracted by segmented tissues of interest. Semi-automatic and fully automatic segmentation approaches. Imaging hardware: SP8 Leica confocal microscope and a HC PL Apo CS2 20 0.75 NA multi-inmersion lens corrected to glycerol immersion. Imaging software: Leica LAS X 3.5.2.18963,Embryos are cleared in CUBIC I to achieve tissue transparency.
